# Pizza Project
That Little Pizza Place is a small pizza restaurant in my hometown of Huntsville, Arkansas, USA. I've never liked their website so I spent a day making a brand new website for them. 

## Design Flaws
Their current website *(as of October 24, 2021)* has way too many design flaws. Mainly their color choices and their font choices. Another huge mistake they have on their website is that they added images of text rather than text itself. This makes it difficult to read because the text on the images is not so clear whenever the image becomes larger. 

There are several other design flaws that I fixed in my version of the website. Although it's not perfect, I believe this is a much better design of their current website. **Currently, the only way to view my version of the website is to download the files and open the home.html file on Chrome.**
